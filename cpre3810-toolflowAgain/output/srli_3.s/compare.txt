Oh no...

Cycle: 1
RARS instruction number: 2	Instruction: srli x5,x5,31
Expected:	Register Write to Reg: 0x05 Val: 0x00000001
Got     :	Register Write to Reg: 0x05 Val: 0xFFFFF01F
Incorrect write

Almost! your processor completed the program with  1/3 allowed mismatches

Helpful resources for Debugging:
ms.trace : output from the VHDL testbench during program execution on your processor
rars.trace : output from RARS containing expected output
vsim.wlf: waveform file generated by processor simulation, you can display this simulation in ModelSim without resimulating your processor by hand
